* If fast raster engraving is important for you, we recommend replacing Smoothieware with grbl-LPC (https://github.com/cprezzi/grbl-LPC) which also runs on the LPC1769 based boards and performs much faster for laser raster applications.

## Wishlist

If you want to contribute, below are long standing community-requested enhancements, that a) we don't have time to code or b) need extra skills

* GCODE Optimiser - to cut down on G0 moves (something like http://parano.github.io/GeneticAlgorithm-TSP/)
* Implement "Raster > TSP-Vector" operation
* More Controllers! Help us implement more firmwares (improve TinyG add Marlin/Repetier, etc)
* WebGL Transformation Filters to use Webcam to setup stock
* Automate Electron Builds for all platforms
